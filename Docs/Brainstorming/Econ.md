# Streamlining Crafting and Combat

- Having three systems (essences, cards, energy) feels clunky.
- Now they are all cards.

The player has two decks: the SPELLS deck and the ESSENCE deck.
- Crafting:
   - When an enemy dies, they drop ESSENCE cards
   - Essence cards have elemental identities
   - You can "expend" ESSENCE cards to craft SPELL cards (in which case they are gone forever)
- Combat:
   - Both of these decks are shuffled at the start of combat, but they don't mix.
   - At the beginning of the game, you draw ~5 cards total from both decks. It's up to the player
     how many spells / essences they draw
   - You PLAY an ESSENCE cards to make an ENERGY
      - This does not burn the card (tentatively)
   - Cards costs energy to play. They may require specific color(s) of energy or just generic energy.
   - Players draw ~3 cards at the beginning of their turn (there is a max handsize at very roughly ~10)
   - When players draw cards, they can draw from either the energy pile and/or the spells pile
   - Your hands are not discarded at the end of your turn

   - Maybe you craft energy cards from essences so it's more on theme? (This might actually be the way to go to make it less confusing)

Side Effects:
- Combat ramps up in later turns, so enemies might need to ramp accordingly
- (Generic) Card draw is insanely rewarding (more than normal card games)
